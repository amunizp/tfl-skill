Tells you when the next bus is due.

## About
Because mycroft 1 and mycroft 2 are meant to be be in one location the idea is to add a discrete list of bus stops in the confibguration page that can then be called to find out if you have to run for the bus or underground.

## Examples
* "Tfl"
* "Bus"
* "Next bus"
* "Richmond bus"
* "Kingston bus"

## Credits
The idea is that this should be shorter process than taking out your phone.
